### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, I would say that the labs were definitely helpful in preparing me to complete the assignment. I was able to more easily wrap my head around the concept of
useState and component hierarchy in React.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

Definitely would have loaved to improve on the visual appeal if given more time, possibly add a toggle button to switch between light and dark mode. A back to top
button would particularly useful for when the user has loaded a lot of pages and wants to go back to the top, either that or a sticky header

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I saw some really creative ideas from my peers such as the suggestions of movies while typing in the search bar. As someone who looks forward to improve on the user
experience of my website, this is a really neat feature.

### Open-source libraries used

Again I used FontAwesome icons

### Shout out

I would love to give a shoutout to Izu, his insight about the .find() function in React came in handy when I needed to fix a bug I noticed with Youtube trailers provided by the API.
